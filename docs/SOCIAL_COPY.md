## 🔧 Copy Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Confident, not arrogant** - "We built something fast" not "We're the best"
- **Transparent about limitations** - Beta = rough edges, and that's OK
- **Community-first** - "Help us build" not "Look what we made"
- **Technical but accessible** - Explain jargon, avoid gatekeeping

### Do's
✅ Use emojis sparingly (2-3 per tweet max)  
✅ Keep sentences short (under 20 words)  
✅ Lead with value proposition (WIIFM - What's In It For Me?)  
✅ Include clear CTAs (Try it, Give feedback, Contribute)  
✅ Tag relevant accounts (if they retweet/engage first)

### Don'ts
❌ Over-hype ("Revolutionary", "Game-changer", "10x better")  
❌ Compare directly to competitors (focus on your strengths)  
❌ Use too many hashtags (#hashtag #spam #is #annoying)  
❌ Post without media (tweets with media get 2-3x engagement)  
❌ Ignore negative feedback (address it publicly and gracefully)
