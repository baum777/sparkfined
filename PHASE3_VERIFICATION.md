## Known Limitations (By Design)

### Phase 3 Scope Boundaries
These features are **intentionally deferred** to future phases:

**Module 8 (Journal):**
- Screenshot storage (blob handling)
- Dexscreener API integration
- Meme-card export feature
- Batch edit/delete operations
- Advanced filters (date range)

**Module 9 (Replay):**
- Video playback controls (play/pause/speed)
- Timeline scrubbing/seeking
- Chart snapshot overlays
- Event filtering in modal
- Session comparison view

These limitations do not affect Beta MVP functionality.

## Mini-Reflection

**Das Journal macht aus flüchtigen Ideen persistente Trading-Erfahrung.**  
The journal transforms ephemeral analysis insights into a structured learning database. Traders can now review their thought patterns, track evolving strategies, and build muscle memory through repetition.

**Die Replay-Timeline visualisiert den Flow der App.**  
Seeing your own event stream reveals how you use the tool. This foundation enables future ML-driven insights, personalized recommendations, and behavioral pattern recognition.

Together, Modules 8 & 9 elevate Sparkfined from a **transient analysis tool** to a **learning companion** that evolves with the trader's journey.
